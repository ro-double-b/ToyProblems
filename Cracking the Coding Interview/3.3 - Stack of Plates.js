const stackOfPlates = () => {

// would create an array of stacks
// there would be a counter to track the index of the last stack used
// also a counter to track the number in the current stack
// there would need to be a constant that is the max stack for all the stack
// when one is added it checks to see if the current stack is at its max
  // if it is it will increate the number of stack counter and create a new stack at the index
  // otherwise it will just increase the number of that particular stack counter 

// pop will have similar removal function but going backwards will check to see the last stack used
